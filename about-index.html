      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I went to the University of Washington and have a Bachelor's degree in English. I worked my way through college in climbing gyms like the Vertical World, and outdoor retail, like Neptune Mountaineering.</p>
      <p>After college I got into Marketing as a writer, and eventually became a communications manager at WhiteWave Foods. I wrote website and packaging content for Silk Soymilk. Later I consulted and wrote copy for Izze, Pharmaca, Simply Organic, and GoodBelly amongst others.</p>
      <p>I am a certified Early Chilhood Montessori pre-k and Kindergarten teacher and taught for 6 years at a 2-room school house in Louisville.</p>
      <p>I've most recently worked as an Admissions Advisor and Evangelist for Galvanize. I feel incredibly grateful to have assisted nine cohorts of students in my time at Galvanize. I got to know those students... their stories, their families, their hopes and fears. Their courage, along with my own curiosity and drive to learn, inspired me to pursue this program too!</p>
